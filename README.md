# Inefficient Recursive Fibonacci

This repository demonstrates an inefficient recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence and provides an optimized solution.

The original code suffers from redundant calculations, leading to exponential time complexity. The solution showcases a dynamic programming approach to significantly improve performance.

## Bug
The `bug.py` file contains the inefficient recursive function.  Observe its slow performance for larger inputs.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.py` file presents an optimized version using dynamic programming, which dramatically reduces computation time.
